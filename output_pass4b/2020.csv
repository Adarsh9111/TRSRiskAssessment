2020,Funding Adequacy & Policy,State contributions rates reflect recertifications and may not agree with original certifications in actuarial reports.
2020,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The actuarially determined net pension liability, calculated as required by GASB Statement No. 67, Financial Reporting for Pension Plans, is dependent on several assumptions including the assumption that future required contributions from all sources are made based on statutory requirements in existence as of the date of this report."
2020,Funding Adequacy & Policy,Totals shown are rates certified by the TRS Board of Trustees based on estimated payrolls and may not total due to rounding.
2020,Funding Adequacy & Policy,Actual amounts collected do not equal amounts estimated by actuaries due to differences between estimated and actual payroll.
2020,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The first factor shown in the table is the difference between actual employer/state contributions and the amount that would cover the employer/state's cost of benefits earned during the year and prevent the prior year’s unfunded liability from growing.  That shortfall was $1.6 billion.
2020,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The methods mandated by the Illinois Pension Code as described in the Funding Adequacy section are inadequate to appropriately fund TRS.
2020,Funding Adequacy & Policy,Public Act 100-0023 requires that the impact on state contributions due to changes in actuarial assumptions be phased in over five years on a retroactive basis. The effect has lowered the FY19 and FY20 state contributions that would have otherwise occurred.
2020,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The State funding has been inadequate, resulting in TRS being among the worst funded public employee retirement systems in the United States."
2020,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The expected benefit payments do not equal the present value of the reserve. The additional amount needed (the unfunded actuarial accrued liability) as calculated by the actuary was $80.7 billion in FY20 based on the actuarial value of assets.
2020,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"TRS ended FY20 with a funded ratio of 40.5 percent. The System had an actuarial value of $54.9 billion in assets and a long-term benefit obligation of $135.6 billion, which creates an unfunded liability of $80.7 billion."
2020,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The TRS Board of Trustees and staff remain vigilant in their efforts to improve the retirement system’s funded status for current and future members.
2020,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"Projected contributions assume that all statutorily required contributions are made through FY22 including projected contributions from members, employers and the State of Illinois (nonemployer contributing entity)."

2020,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The most significant loss was on investments, which includes 20 percent of the difference between expected and actual returns in FY20 and increased the unfunded liability by $973 million during the year."
2020,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The projected unit credit method has the effect of delaying the cost of a member’s service and deferring contributions, thereby leading to higher costs in the long run."
2020,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"In summary, the $2.6 billion increase in the unfunded liability is due to the $1.6 billion employer cost in excess of contributions and the $1.0 billion increase due to experience."
2020,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,"It is important to note that this actuarial valuation is based on plan assets as of June 30, 2020.  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, market conditions have changed significantly since the valuation date. TRS’ actuarial funded status does not reflect short term fluctuations of the market, but rather is based on the fair values on the last day of the plan year. While it is impossible to determine how the market will perform over the next several months, and how that will affect the results of next year’s valuation, Segal is available to prepare projections of potential outcomes upon request."
2020,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,"If the plan’s fiduciary net position is not sufficient to cover all benefit payments to current plan members, GASB Statement No. 67 requires the discount rate to be different from the assumed rate of return. Instead, the discount rate would be a blended rate, which includes the long-term expected rate of return and a municipal bond rate (the Bond Buyer's 20-Bond GO Index) as of the end of the current fiscal year."
2020,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,"The valuation indicates that for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, the actuarial experience of TRS was unfavorable, generating a net actuarial loss of $1.0 billion (0.8% of the actuarial accrued liability). This loss is the net result of a $970 million loss due to unfavorable investment return experience and a $50 million net loss due to demographic experience in fiscal 2020."
2020,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,"As illustrated, the TRS total fund underperformed the policy index by 490 basis points for the year ended June 30, 2020. The fund’s total return also underperformed the 7.0 percent actuarial return assumption and the real rate of return expectation, which is to exceed the rate of inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, by 4.5 percentage points."
2020,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,"The actuarially determined net pension liability, calculated as required by GASB Statement No. 67, Financial Reporting for Pension Plans, is dependent on several assumptions including the assumption that future required contributions from all sources are made based on statutory requirements in existence as of the date of this report."

2020,"Market, Liquidity & Valuation","TRS does not have the authority to pledge or sell collateral securities without borrower default; as such, the collateral security or non-cash collateral is not reported in TRS’s financial statements in accordance with GASB Statement No. 28, ""Accounting and Financial Reporting for Securities Lending Transactions."" as securities on loan can be recalled on demand by TRS or the borrower can return the loaned securities at any time.

2020,"Market, Liquidity & Valuation","Although no one saw the pandemic coming, the resulting economic downturn did not catch TRS off guard. For years, economists have predicted that a downturn eventually would occur. Bearing in mind that risk, TRS employs a highly diversified portfolio designed specifically to help lessen the effects of any economic downturn."
2020,"Market, Liquidity & Valuation","As a result of the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the incidence of COVID-19, economic uncertainties have arisen which may negatively affect the fiduciary net position of the System.
