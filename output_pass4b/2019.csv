2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"Under the TRS Board of Trustee’s funding policy, the state funding requirement is initially higher than under the statutory plan because it begins reducing the unfunded liability immediately. Over time, however, funding based on this actuarial standard greatly reduces state contributions because it reduces the finance charges that occur under the statutory plan."
2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The net effect of the actuarial gains and losses was an increase in the unfunded liability of $0.9 billion. Further increases in the unfunded liability were due to revised assumptions about the impact of the accelerated pension benefit payments described in the Financial Section under “Legislative.”
2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,Buyout payments are contingent upon sufficient bond proceeds being available.
2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The actuarially determined net pension liability, calculated as required by GASB Statements No. 67, is dependent on several assumptions including the assumption that future required contributions from all sources are made based on statutory requirements in existence as of the date of this report."
2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,Buyout payments are contingent upon sufficient bond proceeds being available.
2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The first factor shown in the table is the difference between actual employer/state contributions and the amount that would cover the employer/state's cost of benefits earned during the year and prevent the prior year’s unfunded liability from growing. That shortfall was $1.8 billion.
2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"More importantly, a low-funded ratio leaves TRS with no monetary safety cushion in the event of a slowdown in the investment markets or world economy. It would not take much of a downturn to significantly challenge TRS to meet its obligations over the long term."
2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"As a result of the unfunded liability created primarily by the state’s consistent underfunding, 77 percent of the FY19 state contribution to TRS was dedicated to paying off a portion of the unfunded liability and not the actual cost of benefits."
2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"Because of the unfunded liability, there are dual concerns among decision-makers – that too much of the state budget is dedicated to public pensions and fears that TRS is so far in debt it will be unable to pay all pensions in the future."
2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,This lowered liability savings and increased the unfunded liability by $81 million ($0.1 billion).
2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"However, hope is not a reliable strategy and the risk of not realizing the funding schedule is real."
2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The circumstances in Illinois, where pension contributions in FY19 represented 24 percent of the state’s General Funds budget, may not be sustainable over time as other priorities and services vie for limited state resources."

2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The valuation indicates that for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, the actuarial experience of TRS was unfavorable, generating a net actuarial loss of $942 million (0.7% of the actuarial accrued liability)."
2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,There is a difference between these amounts because actual contributions are based on state statute under a methodology that does not conform to that used to determine the actuarially-determined contribution.
2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,Totals shown are rates certified by the TRS Board of Trustees based on estimated payrolls and may not total due to rounding.
2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,Actual amounts collected do not equal amounts estimated by actuaries due to differences between estimated and actual payroll.
2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The unfunded liability as a percentage of payroll is a standard measure of the relative size of the unfunded liability. Increases in this percentage indicate deterioration in a system’s financial position.
2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"TRS ended FY19 with a funded ratio of 40.6 percent, which is one of the lowest in the nation for a retirement system its size."
2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The most significant loss was on investments, which includes 20 percent of the difference between expected and actual returns in FY19 and increased the unfunded liability by $590 million during the year."
2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"For example, a top priority in a low-funded retirement system is the management of liquidity to ensure that all benefits can be paid."
2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"TRS members have always contributed their share. The State funding has been inadequate, resulting in TRS being among the worst funded public employee retirement systems in the United States."

2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The methods mandated by the Illinois Pension Code as described in the Funding Adequacy section are inadequate to appropriately fund TRS.

2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"Unfortunately, these well-intentioned efforts, at most, would trim only a fraction of the debt owed by all systems, currently $134 billion."
2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"Since 1939, Illinois officials have never, in any year, appropriated enough money to “fully fund” the pension promises to be paid by TRS, as determined by the System’s actuaries."
2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,This loss is the net result of a $590 million loss due to unfavorable investment return experience and a $352 million net loss due to demographic experience in fiscal 2019.
2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"Buyouts are assumed to be paid through June 30, 2022, at which point the assumed $650 million buyout allotment to TRS is expected to be reached."
2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The projected unit credit method has the effect of delaying the cost of a member’s service and deferring contributions, thereby leading to higher costs in the long run."
2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,A disclosure the state included regularly in bond offering documents acknowledges that there is “no assurance” that the state can meet all future pension contributions.
2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The additional amount needed (the unfunded actuarial accrued liability) as calculated by the actuary was $78.1 billion in FY19, based on the actuarial value of assets."
2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"However, the System continues to be buffeted by funding and policy uncertainties within state government that raise the possibility of future insolvency."
2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The statutory formula used to develop state government’s annual contribution to its pension systems artificially lowers the state’s cost of funding pensions.
2019,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"Historically, TRS has relied on the belief that the state will stick to the 24-year-old statutory funding plan for TRS and the other public pension systems."
2019,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,The expected benefit payments do not equal the present value of the reserve.
