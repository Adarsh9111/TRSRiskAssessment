2016,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"Since its founding in 1939, the State of Illinois has never, in any year, funded TRS at a level that standard actuarial practice would define as sufficient to pay its full share of the System’s annual required contribution. In the last decade, for example, actual contributions from the state to TRS fell below the actuarial full-funding standard by an average of $660 million per year."
2016,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The long-term funded status of TRS continues to be among the worst in the nation.
2016,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The $8.7 billion net increase in the 2016 unfunded liability was caused by a combination of factors. The first factor shown in the table is the difference between actual employer/state contributions and the amount that would cover the cost of benefits earned during the year and keep the prior year’s unfunded liability from growing. That shortfall was $1.6 billion.
2016,Funding Adequacy & Policy,TRS faced its share of challenges during FY16. The most prominent challenge was a lingering uncertainty about state government’s financial condition and whether state leaders would be able to make their promised commitment to fund the System. This uncertainty affected all elements of state government.
2016,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"From FY2080 through FY2128, projected plan assets do not cover benefit payments, requiring the utilization of the June 30, 2016 S&P Municipal Bond 20-Year High Grade Rate Index of 2.85 percent for discounting benefit payments due during that 49-year period."
2016,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"In FY16, changes in actuarial assumptions increased the total pension liability by $7.6 billion."
2016,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The calculation of the discount rate assumes that all statutorily required contributions are made for all years in the future which includes projected contributions from members, employers, and the State of Illinois (nonemployer contributing entity)."
2016,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The net effect of the economic assumptions was to increase the unfunded liability by $6.1 billion.
2016,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The methods are mandated by the Illinois Pension Code and are inadequate to appropriately fund TRS.
2016,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The most significant was the actuarial loss on investments, which includes 20 percent of the difference between expected and actual returns in FY16 and increased the unfunded liability by $467 million during the year."
2016,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"If the assumed rate of return is too high, funding requirements would be set at an artifi- cially low level."
2016,Funding Adequacy & Policy,There is a difference between these amounts because actual contributions are based on state statute under a methodology that does not conform to that used to determine the actuarially-determined contribution.
2016,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"Due to partisan differences over public policy questions, the legislative and executive branches of Illinois government failed to reach an agreement on a FY16 state budget during the entire 12-month period."
2016,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The unfunded actuarial accrued liability was $71.4 billion at June 30, 2016. The funded ratio was 39.8 percent at June 30, 2016."
2016,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The State funding has been inadequate, resulting in TRS being among the worst funded public employee retirement systems in the United States."
2016,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"TRS, with the assistance of the actuary, projected that the Plan’s fiduciary net position will not be sufficient to provide for all benefit payments to current plan members."
