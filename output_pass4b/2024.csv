2024,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"If the plan’s fiduciary net position is not sufficient to cover all benefit payments to current plan members, GASB Statement No. 67 requires the discount rate to be different from the assumed rate of return. Instead, the discount rate would be a blended rate, which includes the long-term expected rate of return and a municipal bond rate (the Bond Buyer's 20-Bond GO Index) as of the end of the current fiscal year."
2024,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"While we have seen significant improvement, the System’s funded ratio remains low."
2024,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The $1.7 billion net increase in the 2024 unfunded liability was caused by a combination of factors. The first factor shown in the reconciliation table is the difference between actual employer/state contributions and the amount that would cover the employer/state's cost of benefits earned during the year and prevent the prior year’s unfunded liability from growing. That shortfall was $525 million.
2024,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The actuarially determined net pension liability, calculated as required by GASB Statement No. 67, Financial Reporting for Pension Plans, is dependent on several assumptions including the assumption that future required contributions from all sources are made based on statutory requirements in existence as of the date of this report."
2024,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The net effect of the actuarial gains and losses was an increase in the unfunded liability of $1.3 billion.
2024,Funding Adequacy & Policy,State contributions rates reflect recertifications and may not agree with original certifications in actuarial reports.
2024,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"In summary, the $1.7 billion increase in the unfunded liability is the net effect of the $0.5 billion employer cost in excess of contributions and the $1.2 billion gain due to experience and changes in assumption."
2024,Funding Adequacy & Policy,Totals shown are rates certified by the TRS Board of Trustees based on estimated payrolls and may not total due to rounding.

2024,Funding Adequacy & Policy,Actual amounts collected do not equal amounts estimated by actuaries due to differences between estimated and actual payroll.

2024,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of additions to and deductions from net position during the reporting period.
