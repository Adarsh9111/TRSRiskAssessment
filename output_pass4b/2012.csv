2012,Funding Adequacy & Policy,TRS’s unfunded liability stands at $52 billion.
2012,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"Per statutory requirement, 20% is recognized in the actuarial value of assets as of June 30, 2012, and recognition of the remaining 80%, or $2,328,690,142, will be deferred and recognized in equal amounts over the next four valuations. Depending on the whether the total net deferral is an investment gain or loss, the smoothing method will produce a contribution rate that is more or less than the rate based on the market value. As of the June 30, 2012 valuation the total net deferral is a $1,428,571,872 loss, resulting in a contribution that is lower than it would be if the assets were valued at market."
2012,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"Public Act 94-0004 has resulted in contributions to the System much less than those that would be contributed under generally accepted actuarial standards. Under such standards, a funded ratio of 100% would be achieved within 30 years as opposed to the 90% funded ratio achieved by 2045 under Public Act 94-0004. In addition, under actuarial standards contributions would not be based on members not currently in the System as is done under Public Act 94-0004, particularly given the lower value of Tier II benefits in the System for members hired on or after January 1, 2011."
2012,Funding Adequacy & Policy,Paying off this debt will require over $200 billion in state funds over the next 30 years.
2012,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The employer cost in excess of contributions is the shortfall between actual employer contributions and the amount needed to cover the cost of benefits earned during the year and to keep the unfunded liability from growing. In 2012, this shortfall was $2.7 billion and in 2011 it was $1.9 billion."
2012,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The funded ratio decreased from 46.5 percent at June 30, 2011 to 42.1 percent at June 30, 2012."
2012,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"An actuarial study was conducted in 2012 to review the adequacy of ERO contributions. The cost of the nonreduced benefits is not fully covered by the ERO contributions. Continuation of the ERO program beyond June 30, 2013 will depend on legislative action."
2012,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The net increase in the June 30, 2012, unfunded liability of $8.6 billion was caused by a combination of factors."
2012,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"In response to this situation, the TRS Board of Trustees approved a resolution in early 2012 that acknowledged the threat of insolvency and established a five-point foundation to guide any pension change designed to secure the future."
2012,Funding Adequacy & Policy,State funding requirements based on market value assets were also immediately impacted and therefore more volatile.
2012,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The TRS Trustees have resolved that without any changes, the System faces the real possibility of future insolvency."
2012,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"Absent any corrective action, it is likely that we won’t be able to keep those promises at some point in the future."
2012,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"Going forward, unless changes are made, these factors will further undermine the state’s responsibility to fully fund teacher pensions annually and to keep retirement promises to TRS members first established in 1939."
2012,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"With only 40.6 percent of the market-value assets required to pay benefits on hand as of June 30, 2012, TRS, together with the other Illinois pension systems, is the worst funded major pension system in the country."
2012,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The unfunded actuarial accrued liability increased from $43.5 billion at June 30, 2011 to $52.1 billion at June 30, 2012."
2012,Funding Adequacy & Policy,Delayed reporting of retirements also increased the unfunded liability because more people were receiving benefits than expected.
2012,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The long-term sustainability of the System, however, remains uncertain due to the bleak fiscal condition of the State of Illinois."
2012,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The continued use of Public Act 94-0004 in its current form will continue the history of an inadequate funded ratio of less than 100%.
2012,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The decline in the funded ratio was due to an increase in the liability mainly due to new actuarial assumptions and the continued phase-in of prior investment losses.
2012,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"When the funded ratio was based on the market value of assets, the reported funded ratio was impacted immediately by changes in market conditions."
2012,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The additional amount needed (the unfunded actuarial accrued liability) as calculated by the actuary was $52,079,548,000 in 2012 and $43,529,992,000 in 2011."

2012,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,"The $4.6 billion net increase in the unfunded liability was due to three major factors: a reduction in the assumed rate of return (from 8.5 percent to 8.0 percent), a reduction in the salary increase assumption (from an average of 7.0 percent to 6.0 percent), and mortality improvements that are expected to continue over future generations."
2012,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,The expected benefit payments do not equal the present value of the reserve.

2012,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,"Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities, it is at least reasonably possible that value changes will occur in the near-term and such changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the Statement of Plan Net Assets."
2012,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,"In both years, actuarial losses occurred under the mortality assumptions because fewer people died than expected."
2012,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,State funding requirements based on market value assets were also immediately impacted and therefore more volatile.
2012,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,"The total return also lagged the 8.5 percent actuarial return assumption and the real rate of return expectation, which is to exceed the rate of inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, by 5.0 percentage points."

2012,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,"Under the investment return assumption, losses occurred both years. In FY12, smoothed assets were assumed to earn $3.2 billion, but earnings were actually $1.4 billion."
