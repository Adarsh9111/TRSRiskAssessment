2015,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"Federal contributions above are expressed as percentages of total active member payroll. Through FY05, employers contributed 10.5 percent of pay as the employer contribution for members paid from federal sources. Beginning in FY06, the employer contribution rate paid on behalf of members paid from federal sources is the same as the employer contribution rate paid by the State of Illinois on behalf of members not paid from federal sources 7.06 percent in FY06, 9.78 percent in FY07, 13.11 percent in FY08, 17.08 percent in FY09, 23.38 percent in FY10, 23.10 percent in FY11, 24.91 percent in FY12, 28.05 percent in FY13, 35.41 percent in FY14, and 33.00 percent in FY15."
2015,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The System incurred a loss of $1,621,728,539 in FY 2015.  Per statutory requirement, 20% is recognized in the actuarial value of assets as of June 30, 2015, and recognition of the remaining 80%, or $1,297,382,831, will be deferred and recognized in equal amounts over the next four valuations.  Depending on whether the total net deferral is an investment gain or loss, the smoothing method will produce a contribution rate that is more or less than the rate based on the market value."
2015,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The unfunded obligations owed members have increased by 450 percent since 2000.
2015,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The first factor shown in the table is the difference between actual employer/state contributions and the amount that would cover the cost of benefits earned during the year and keep the prior year’s unfunded liability from growing.  That shortfall was $2.0 billion and was the most significant factor in the increase in the unfunded liability.
2015,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"This report illustrates the effective and efficient administration of one of the 30 largest public pension systems in the United States despite a large unfunded liability caused by seven decades of insufficient government funding, the on-going fiscal problems faced by the State of Illinois and increasing volatility in the world economy."
2015,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The $1.1 billion net increase in the 2015 unfunded liability was caused by a combination of factors.
2015,Funding Adequacy & Policy,FY06 and FY07 rates were due to specific dollar appropriation specified in Public Act 94-0004 that were not based on the statutory ramp schedule. FY08 through FY10 rates are based on statutory ramp schedule. FY11 rate is based on recertification requirements of Pubic Act 96-1511. FY12 – FY15 were based on the statutory formula.
2015,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The actuarially determined pension liability, calculated as required by GASB Statement No. 67, is dependent on several assumptions including the assumption that future required contributions from all sources are made based on statutory requirements in existence as of the date of this report."
2015,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The long-term funded status of TRS continues to be the worst in the nation among large public pension systems.
2015,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"From FY2081 through FY2086, projected plan assets do not cover benefit payments, requiring the utilization of the June 30, 2015 S&P Municipal Bond 20-Year High Grade Rate Index of 3.73 percent for discounting benefit payments due during that six-year period."
2015,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"As a result, while the State Comptroller’s Office has indicated its intent to fully pay the state’s FY16 contribution to TRS, it is not certain whether state government always will be able to remit the authorized contribution on a timely basis during FY16."
2015,Funding Adequacy & Policy,Totals shown are rates certified by the TRS Board of Trustees based on estimated payrolls and may not total due to rounding. Actual amounts collected do not equal amounts estimated by actuaries due to differences between estimated and actual payroll.
2015,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The expected benefit payments do not equal the present value of the reserve. The additional amount needed (the unfunded actuarial accrued liability) as calculated by the actuary was $62.7 billion in FY15, based on the actuarial value of assets."
2015,Funding Adequacy & Policy,A large unfunded liability threatens the System’s ability to continue the investment returns that are vital to the security of TRS.
2015,Funding Adequacy & Policy,Contributions for minimum benefits from the state and for excess sick from employers do not count towards actuarial funding requirements.
2015,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The fiscal problems of Illinois state government festered at a time when the global economy became increasingly volatile and unpredictable, which dramatically lowered earnings for large institutional investors."
2015,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The lack of a comprehensive state budget and lack of sufficient revenue left the state short of available cash at times to pay its obligations.
2015,Funding Adequacy & Policy,There is a difference between these amounts because actual contributions are based on state statute under a methodology that does not conform to that used to determine the actuarially-determined contribution.
2015,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"While TRS members have always contributed their share, the State funding has been less than adequate to make progress in the funding of the plan."
2015,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The FY15 total employer rate is the same as originally certified by the TRS Board of Trustees but the state component is lower and the federal component is higher than originally certified due to PA 98-0674.
2015,Funding Adequacy & Policy,This dispute only intensified the systemic imbalance between state government revenue and spending that some estimates put as high as $8.5 billion.
2015,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The FY15 state contribution reflects a $35 million reduction in the originally-certified state contribution under Public Act 98-0674, which increased federal contributions and reduced state contributions."
2015,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"Throughout most of calendar year 2015, state officials engaged in a dispute over spending, revenue and public policy issues along partisan lines that delayed enactment of a state budget for FY16."
2015,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"At the end of FY15, for funding purposes the System’s funded ratio stood at 42.0 percent, on an actuarial basis, with a long-term unfunded liability of $62.7 billion."
2015,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"A key feature of this act is the “continuing appropriation” language that requires State contributions to be made automatically to TRS, provided State funds are available."
2015,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"State officials continually question the size of the state’s annual contribution to TRS, which in FY15 was $3.4 billion, or 10.3 percent of the state’s general funds budget."
2015,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"TRS, with the assistance of the actuary, projected that the Plan’s fiduciary net position will not be sufficient to provide for all benefit payments to current plan members."
2015,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,"The System incurred a loss of $1,621,728,539 in FY 2015.

Depending on whether the total net deferral is an investment gain or loss, the smoothing method will produce a contribution rate that is more or less than the rate based on the market value."
2015,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,Future actuarial measurements may differ significantly from the current measurement presented in this report due to such factors as:  plan experience different from that anticipated by the economic and demographic assumptions; increases or decreases expected as part of the natural operation of the methodology used for these measurements; and changes in plan provisions or applicable law.
