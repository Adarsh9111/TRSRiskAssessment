2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The standard goal is 100 percent.
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The funding formula is back end loaded.
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The $1.9 billion net increase in the 2018 unfunded liability was caused by a combination of factors. The first factor shown in the table is the difference between actual employer/state contributions and the amount that would cover the employer/state's cost of benefits earned during the year and prevent the prior year’s unfunded liability from growing. That shortfall was $1.9 billion.
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The state’s long-term goal is a 90 percent funded ratio.
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"Under the 50-year funding plan, TRS will attain a funded ratio of 90 percent by 2045."
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"In other words, TRS currently holds just 40 cents for every $1 it owes to all members."
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The actuarially determined pension liability, calculated as required by GASB Statements No. 67, is dependent on several assumptions including the assumption that future required contributions from all sources are made based on statutory requirements in existence as of the date of this report."
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"As of June 30, 2018, TRS is 40.7 percent funded and carries a $75 billion unfunded liability."
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"Historically, TRS has relied on the belief that the state will stick to a 23-year-old statutory funding plan for TRS and the other public pension systems that requires state government to allocate enough money annually to eliminate most of the systems’ unfunded liabilities over time."
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"However, hope is not a reliable strategy and a sustainable funding solution has yet to emerge."
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"As more Tier 2 members enter TRS, the combined employer normal cost continues to fall. By 2044, the combined employer normal cost is negative. In the meantime, the cost of Tier 1, which is a closed group, continues to increase as Tier 1 members age and accrue more service."
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,Future savings from reductions in retiree benefits are counted now before they are actually realized.
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The biggest reason for the huge TRS unfunded liability is decades of underfunding by state government.
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,Tier 2 would be overfunded because member contributions are higher than the cost of Tier 2 benefits. The surplus Tier 2 assets lower the employer/state contributions required for Tier 1. Tier 2 active members are projected to outnumber Tier 1 active members by 2025.
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"Because of these strategic changes, expected returns would fall, making the funding challenge even greater."
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,It would not take a significant change in current conditions to put TRS on a path towards significant difficulty.
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The statutory pension funding formula in Illinois diverges from several generally-accepted actuarial funding standards.
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The expected benefit payments do not equal the present value of the reserve. The additional amount needed (the unfunded actuarial accrued liability) as calculated by the actuary was $75.3 billion in FY18, based on the actuarial value of assets."
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,Circumstances where pension contributions represent more than 20 percent of the state’s budget likely are not sustainable.
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"Projected contributions assume that all statutorily required contributions are made through FY2120 including projected contributions from members, employers and the State of Illinois (nonemployer contributing entity)."
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"Unfortunately, Illinois law mandates every year that TRS and the state’s other pension systems are continually underfunded."
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"If the funded ratio were to drop further, the portfolio would need to become more liquid and our investments more conservative in order to have ready access to the cash necessary to fund an expanding benefit payroll."
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"Since 1939, Illinois officials have never once set aside enough money to “fully fund” the pension promises to be paid by TRS."
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,A well-funded plan has the capacity to absorb “down years.” A plan like TRS with a funded ratio already below 50 percent would be unable to absorb any financial shocks created by a sustained downturn in the markets.
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,There is a difference between these amounts because actual contributions are based on state statute under a methodology that does not conform to that used to determine the actuarially-determined contribution.
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"While we have substantial assets, the fiscal health of the Teachers’ Retirement System is exposed to any future economic downturn."
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,We strongly recommend an actuarial funding method that targets 100% funding where payments at least cover interest on the unfunded actuarial accrued liability and a portion of the principal balance.
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The state’s annual contribution is reduced each year by the amount of debt service needed to pay off pension obligation bonds sold more than a decade ago to finance the state’s annual contribution.
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The methods mandated by the Illinois Pension Code as described in the Funding Adequacy section are inadequate to appropriately fund TRS.
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The employer normal cost rate measures the employer’s cost of the benefits being earned by active teachers during the year. It does not include any contributions towards the unfunded liability.
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The State funding has been inadequate, resulting in TRS being among the worst funded public employee retirement systems in the United States."
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"As a result, 75 percent of the $4.09 billion Illinois taxpayers allocated for teacher pensions in FY18 was dedicated to paying for prior funding shortfalls, not the actual cost of benefits."
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,The TRS funded ratio is at a level where the System’s investment strategy could be negatively impacted by a future downturn in the investment markets.
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"By 2045, Tier 1 would be 84 percent funded and Tier 2 would be 122 percent funded, with the combined plan attaining the 90 percent target funded ratio."
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The formula used to develop state government’s annual contribution to its pension systems, as dictated in the pension code, artificially lowers the state’s cost of funding pensions."
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The chart below shows that while the combined employer normal cost of both tiers in 2020 is over 10 percent of pay, the cost of Tier 2 is negative and stays negative through 2045."
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"However, the successes of TRS and the positive effects of member benefits throughout Illinois are overshadowed by the System’s marginal financial condition."
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"Despite long-term investment returns that exceed expectations, the investment of TRS assets alone will never generate enough money to overcome the unfunded liability."
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,A disclosure the state included in recent bond offering documents acknowledges that there could be “no assurance” that the state could meet its future obligations.
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,Our first priority is to pay our member benefits and closely manage the liquidity of our portfolio to ensure that we have the cash needed to meet our obligations.
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"TRS, with the assistance of the System's actuary, projected that the plan’s fiduciary net position will provide for all benefit payments to current plan members."
2018,Funding Adequacy & Policy,"The state’s funding plan covers 50 years, when the standard practice is to amortize over 30 years but use an even shorter period for a severely underfunded plan."
2018,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of additions to and deductions from net position during the reporting period.
2018,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,Actual results could differ from these estimates.
2018,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,The $1.9 billion net increase in the 2018 unfunded liability was caused by a combination of factors.

2018,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,Future savings from reductions in retiree benefits are counted now before they are actually realized.
2018,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,The most significant actuarial loss was under the “other” category. The loss of $983 million is a balancing item and includes corrections to various calculations and methodologies that will prevent additional losses due to these items from occurring in the future.
2018,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,"Because of these strategic changes, expected returns would fall, making the funding challenge even greater."

2018,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,"The valuation indicates that for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, the actuarial experience of TRS was unfavorable, generating a net actuarial loss of $1,035 million (0.8% of the actuarial accrued liability)."
2018,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,There is a difference between these amounts because actual contributions are based on state statute under a methodology that does not conform to that used to determine the actuarially-determined contribution.
2018,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,The accuracy of the results presented in this report is dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of the underlying information.
2018,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,We strongly recommend an actuarial funding method that targets 100% funding where payments at least cover interest on the unfunded actuarial accrued liability and a portion of the principal balance.
2018,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,"Cheiron suggested additional disclosure on stress testing, but this has not been included in the 2018 preliminary actuarial valuation."
2018,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,The methods mandated by the Illinois Pension Code as described in the Funding Adequacy section are inadequate to appropriately fund TRS.
2018,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,The employer normal cost rate measures the employer’s cost of the benefits being earned by active teachers during the year. It does not include any contributions towards the unfunded liability.
2018,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,"If the plan’s assets are not sufficient to cover all benefit payments to current plan members, GASB Statement No. 67 requires the discount rate to be different from the assumed rate of return."
2018,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,"Actuarial losses occurred under the assumptions for retirement, terminations, mortality and rehires (members coming back into teaching service)."
2018,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,"The chart below shows that while the combined employer normal cost of both tiers in 2020 is over 10 percent of pay, the cost of Tier 2 is negative and stays negative through 2045."
2018,Actuarial & Measurement Risk,"TRS, with the assistance of the System's actuary, projected that the plan’s fiduciary net position will provide for all benefit payments to current plan members."
2018,"Market, Liquidity & Valuation","Since loans are terminable at will, the maturity of loans generally does not match the maturity of collateral investments. As of June 30, 2018, TRS had outstanding loaned investment securities with a fair value of $2,350,239,549 against which it had received cash and non-cash collateral with a fair value of $2,453,194,510."
2018,"Market, Liquidity & Valuation","Investments in certain limited partnerships commit TRS to possible future capital contributions. As of June 30, 2018, TRS had remaining unfunded commitments of $6,782,990,072 within the real estate, other real assets, private equity, diversifying strategies and global fixed income asset classes."
2018,"Market, Liquidity & Valuation","Investment securities are exposed to a variety of risk including credit, market and interest rate risk."
2018,"Market, Liquidity & Valuation",Investments in limited partnerships are normally long-term with an approximate life of 10 to 12 years and considered illiquid. Investors are subject to redemption restrictions which limit and restrict the ability of limited partners to exit prior to dissolution.
2018,"Market, Liquidity & Valuation","Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities, it is at least reasonably possible that value changes will occur in the near-term and such changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the Statement of Fiduciary Net Position."
2018,"Market, Liquidity & Valuation","Real estate returns moderated to normalized/sustainable levels in FY18. Overall, real estate market fundamentals remain strong, which supports continued favorable income returns; however, appreciation returns have diminished to more typical levels."
2018,"Market, Liquidity & Valuation",Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely impact the fair value of an investment.
2018,"Market, Liquidity & Valuation","If the funded ratio were to drop further, the portfolio would need to become more liquid and our investments more conservative in order to have ready access to the cash necessary to fund an expanding benefit payroll."
2018,"Market, Liquidity & Valuation","Most experts predict that a market “correction,” or downturn, is much more likely in the near future than a continued “up trend.”"
2018,"Market, Liquidity & Valuation","To varying degrees, derivative transactions involve credit risk, sometimes known as default or counterparty risk and market risk."
2018,"Market, Liquidity & Valuation","TRS’s real estate managers have been active in the market throughout the year, upgrading the portfolios by identifying investments that provide downside protection in the event of a market correction."
2018,"Market, Liquidity & Valuation","TRS’s currency risk exposure, or exchange rate risk, is primarily derived from its holdings in foreign currency-denominated equity, fixed income and derivative investments as well as foreign currency."
2018,"Market, Liquidity & Valuation","Market risk is the possibility that a change in interest, currency or other pertinent market rates will cause the value of a financial instrument to decrease or become more costly to settle."
2018,"Market, Liquidity & Valuation",The TRS funded ratio is at a level where the System’s investment strategy could be negatively impacted by a future downturn in the investment markets.
2018,"Market, Liquidity & Valuation","The opportunistic funds outperformed relative to NCREIF by 630 bps for one-year, 440 bps for three-year and 450 bps for five-year, while under-performing NCREIF by 130 bps for 10 years."
2018,"Market, Liquidity & Valuation","Due to the risk profile inherent within opportunistic real estate investments, these assets are included in the equity asset class for reporting purposes."
2018,"Market, Liquidity & Valuation","Geopolitics, including elections and political controversy in several countries, dominated headlines and contributed to brief periods of market volatility."
2018,"Market, Liquidity & Valuation","Successful implementation of this target is subject to many factors, including public market performance and sufficient availability of high quality private equity opportunities."
2018,"Market, Liquidity & Valuation","The U.S. Federal Reserve continued to modestly raise interest rates during FY18, while unwinding its balance sheet, contributing to a flattening yield curve."
2018,"Market, Liquidity & Valuation",TRS continues increasing exposures to private debt opportunities and maintains a bias away from U.S. and global fixed income indices as benchmark investments.
2018,"Market, Liquidity & Valuation",Our first priority is to pay our member benefits and closely manage the liquidity of our portfolio to ensure that we have the cash needed to meet our obligations.
2018,"Market, Liquidity & Valuation","Investing in private equity carries additional risk, but with skillful selection of managers, returns can be significantly higher than public equity investments."
2018,"Market, Liquidity & Valuation","As of June 30, 2018, it is probable that all investments in this type will be sold at an amount different from the current NAV of the Plan’s ownership interest."
2018,"Credit, Counterparty & Concentration","Non-exchange traded derivative instruments may expose TRS to credit/counterparty risk. TRS investment managers reduce credit risk by evaluating the credit quality and operational capabilities of the counterparties. Because the counterparty risk of a security will fluctuate with market movements, all TRS managers using non-exchange traded derivatives operate a collateral call process ensuring full collateralization of these derivatives. TRS does not have a policy regarding master netting arrangements."

2018,"Credit, Counterparty & Concentration","To varying degrees, derivative transactions involve credit risk, sometimes known as default or counterparty risk and market risk."
2018,"Credit, Counterparty & Concentration","At fiscal-year end, TRS has no credit risk exposure to borrowers because the amount TRS owes the borrowers exceeds the amount the borrowers owe TRS."
2018,"Credit, Counterparty & Concentration","Written credit default swaps increase credit exposure (selling protection), obligating the portfolio to buy debt from counterparties in the event of a default."
2018,"Operational, Legal & Governance","Non-exchange traded derivative instruments may expose TRS to credit/counterparty risk.
