Depending on the whether the total net deferral is an investment gain or loss, the smoothing method will produce a contribution rate that is more or less than the rate based on the market value. As of the June 30, 2012 valuation the total net deferral is a $1,428,571,872 loss, resulting in a contribution that is lower than it would be if the assets were valued at market."
