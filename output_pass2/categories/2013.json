      "representative_snippet": "For the year ended June 30, 2013, TRS earned net income of $13.9 million through its securities lending program. The decrease from prior year was driven primarily by a weaker securities lending market. The global equity rally, combined with the uncertainty of regulatory changes, resulted in the market producing fewer short posi-\ntions required to be covered by broker/dealers. The securities lending market experienced significant spread compression, or decrease in lending fees, creating a reduction in hard to borrow “specials” resulting in lower return to lendable."
