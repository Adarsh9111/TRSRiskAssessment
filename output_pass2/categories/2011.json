As of October 31, 2011, the market value of the assets has declined approximately $2.004 billion or 5.4 percent.

Actuarial losses were also incurred under the turnover assumption because fewer people left service than assumed. Additionally, many members repaid refunds, and the repurchased service increased the unfunded liability. Delayed reporting of retirements also increased the unfunded liability because more people were receiving benefits than expected."
