Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, market conditions have changed significantly since the valuation date. TRS’ actuarial funded status does not reflect short term fluctuations of the market, but rather is based on the fair values on the last day of the plan year. While it is impossible to determine how the market will perform over the next several months, and how that will affect the results of next year’s valuation, Segal is available to prepare projections of potential outcomes upon request."
