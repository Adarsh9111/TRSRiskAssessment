      "representative_snippet": "The $1.9 billion net increase in the 2018 unfunded liability was caused by a combination of factors. The first factor shown in the table is the difference between actual employer/state contributions and the amount that would cover the employer/state's cost of benefits earned during the year and prevent the prior year’s unfunded liability from growing. That shortfall was $1.9 billion."

TRS investment managers reduce credit risk by evaluating the credit quality and operational capabilities of the counterparties. Because the counterparty risk of a security will fluctuate with market movements, all TRS managers using non-exchange traded derivatives operate a collateral call process ensuring full collateralization of these derivatives. TRS does not have a policy regarding master netting arrangements."
